As far as build planning software goes, Hellforge intends to be the cream of the crop. The selling point of Hellforge is that it is playable! Classes, skills, and affixes from Diablo 4 will be replicated as closely as possible, so if you're ever curious how your new theory-crafted build might play, you don't have to commit to leveling an entire character in Diablo 4. Quickly whip it up in Hellforge, spawn some demons, and see how it feels right then and there.

I expect Diablo 4 to make many changes before the official release, and all data that currently exists will probably be invalidated. Because of this, Hellforge is designed in a way to make it as quick and easy as possible to create new classes, affixes, talents, and items. It's so easy, Hellforge can be modified to work for other games too.

### Feature Roadmap

Hellforge is currently in a very early pre-alpha state.  No support will be provided until later stages when the codebase is more concrete.  When Hellforge is solid and playable, I will publish an official release with the compiled executable.
